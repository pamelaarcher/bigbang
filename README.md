</h2>
<p>
This code creates a <i>factory</i> that generates red and blue balls and has them move around the screen in random patterns
</p>

<h2>
Project Details
</h2>
<p>

</p>
<ol>
   <li> function <i>factory</i> is responsible for the creation of an input number of ball currently set to 100 which it creates as an object element in the area object. It calls <i>getRandom</i> for the random movement and <i>makeBall</i> to create the ball</li>
   <li> After creation of the balls, Function <i>update()</i> moves a ball location.  It also calls <i>checkWalls(i)</i> which checks to see if the ball is still within the page rectangular area and if hitting the edge changes the ball direction </li>
</ol>
